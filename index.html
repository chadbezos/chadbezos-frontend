    <h1>ChadBezos, the meme coin stirring away from the virgin Musk</h1>
    <h3>Meme coins have been centered around a weak and disgusting human being, representing the opposite of a chad: Elon Musk, simply because his involvment with crypto. It is time we praise chads who can run multi-billion dollars companies but also seduce women with their impeccable persona and action movie like body.

            <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
            <p>Classic meme coin tokenomics: 10,000,000,000 total supply<br/>1% owned by the team<br />5% fees to ensure some money goes to the protocol for buybacks.<br />Yeah these tokenomics seems ridiculous but they are the gold standard for meme coins so we are going with it so that we reach the maximum amount of community members.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fees">
            <h2>Team</h2>
            <p>an experienced DeFi team simply going for a meme project. We have worked on various protocols having up to $1,000,000 TVL (yes I know very impressive as I do say myself). For those of you who can read solidity (I assume none), an audit is on the way if the project starts to get a bit of traction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <h2>Marketing</h2>
            <p>We strongly believe that the chad mentality is starting to take off and that Jeff Bezos perfectly encapsulates this mind set and is a very well known persona that can carry this project. We will be present on reddit, telegram, discord, twitter, and in various shilling groups to bring later buyers so that the early buyers can dump on them.... Wait nevermind...</p>
